## Project: Children Paint Chinese Railroad Workers《华童画华工》
Contributed six original illustrations to the bilingual picture book _Children Paint Chinese Railroad Workers_, which tells the story of the Chinese laborers who built America’s first transcontinental railroad.
Work was exhibited at the Boston Public Library during its first-ever “Chinese American Children’s Art Month” and later toured schools and libraries nationwide like Stanford, Yale, and Princeton.
