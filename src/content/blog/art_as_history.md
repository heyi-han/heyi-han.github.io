## Project: Children Paint Chinese Railroad Workers《华童画华工》
Contributed six original illustrations to the bilingual picture book Children Paint Chinese Railroad Workers, which tells the story of the Chinese laborers who built America’s first transcontinental railroad.
Work was exhibited at the Boston Public Library during its first-ever “Chinese American Children’s Art Month” and later toured schools and libraries nationwide.
