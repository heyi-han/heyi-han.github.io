At Rutgers University, I worked with Professor Pengju Zhang on the project Women’s Representation and Compassionate Policy Making, helping design interview questions for female mayors and participating in interviews. I focused on questions for young people, exploring the challenges female leaders face and the advice they would give to the next generation. In March 2025, I had the opportunity to present our preliminary findings at Rutgers Newark’s School of Public Affairs and Administration (SPAA). This experience gave me a deeper understanding of empathy, representation, and how leadership can shape positive social change.
