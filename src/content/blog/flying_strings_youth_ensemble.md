As the cofounder and president of the Flying Strings Youth Ensemble, I lead a community of over 50 young musicians from across the country who share a deep passion for Chinese music, cultural storytelling, and cross-generational connection. What began in 2023 as a small group of friends rehearsing traditional pieces together has since grown into a nationally recognized nonprofit organization with branches in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and California—officially registered in 2024.

In my role as president, I oversee rehearsals, manage outreach, and organize performances that bring Chinese music to diverse audiences, from the Philadelphia Museum of Art to Harvard, Princeton, and Rutgers Universities, as well as public schools, libraries, and senior centers. Each performance serves as both an artistic exchange and a bridge between cultures, allowing audiences to experience the beauty and depth of traditional Chinese instruments in a modern, collaborative context.

Beyond the stage, I see Flying Strings as a platform for cultural dialogue and storytelling—where young musicians can celebrate their heritage, share their creativity, and build meaningful connections through the universal language of music. Leading this ensemble has allowed me to grow as both an artist and a leader, blending tradition with innovation and transforming a shared love of music into a movement that preserves culture while inspiring understanding and unity across communities.

## About Flying Strings Youth Ensemble
