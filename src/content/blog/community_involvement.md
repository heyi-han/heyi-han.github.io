As one of only two student members of the Mountain Lakes Historic Preservation Committee, I’ve been thrilled to take an active role in preserving and celebrating our town’s rich history. Every month, I attend committee meetings where we <b>brainstorm, plan, and coordinate local preservation projects</b>, from maintaining historic landmarks to organizing community events. Beyond the meetings, I dive into research and storytelling, <b>writing historical pieces</b> for the Mountain Lakes High School newsletter that bring the past to life for students and neighbors alike.

I also conduct interviews and oral histories with longtime residents, capturing their memories and personal stories so that our community’s heritage is preserved for future generations. Being part of this committee has allowed me not only to contribute to meaningful projects but also to connect with residents of all ages, celebrate our shared history, and feel a real sense of belonging and purpose in my community.
