I created an AI-assisted short documentary exploring Chinese American immigrant journeys, blending visual storytelling, historical research, and technology. Most specifically, I focused on Joseph Pierce, a Chinese-American Union soldier in the Civil War. This project went beyond reporting his life—I immersed myself in archives, historical texts, and oral histories, tracing Pierce’s story through documents, photographs, and period records. I visited national libraries like the Library of Congress, consulted with historians, and experimented with AI tools to reimagine his experiences visually and emotionally. The process became a personal journey of discovery, connecting me to broader narratives of Chinese American resilience and identity, and allowing me to bring forgotten histories to life for contemporary audiences.
