My artwork explores emotion, memory, and identity through color and composition. I try to explore different scenery, stages of my life, and fleeting moments that have shaped who I am. Each piece becomes a reflection of how I perceive the world—sometimes through nostalgia, sometimes through chaos, but always through sincerity. I often layer colors and textures to capture the complexity of emotions that can’t be easily named, using composition to mirror the tension between what is remembered and what is lost. In doing so, my art becomes both a personal archive and an evolving dialogue between my inner world and the external one. To me, art is a form of expression and peace, but also how I understand who I am and where I come from.

In doing so, I also employ a multitude of techniques and mediums to portray such depictions. These mediums include oil painting, Chinese traditional ink paintings, Watercolor paintings, Digital media, and even encaustic wax techniques. Explorations of these mediums help me find meaning in textures, colors, and just the process of art.
