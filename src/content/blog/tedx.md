description: "From my first TEDx talk in fifth grade to high school debate championships and bilingual storytelling events, public speaking has shaped my voice as a communicator and leader.
In 2024, I represented youth speakers at the Chinese American Convention in Washington, D.C., leading peers to visit Capitol Hill and deliver a bilingual speech on immigrant history."
