I served as a bilingual speaker and visual contributor for the Hua Tong Hua community education series, an ongoing initiative dedicated to sharing Chinese American stories through art, dialogue, and intergenerational exchange. In this role, I’ve worked to bridge the gap between history and audience—using both language and visual art as tools to make cultural narratives accessible, relatable, and emotionally resonant. I design and present bilingual talks that weave together personal reflection, historical research, and creative illustration, allowing complex stories of migration, resilience, and identity to come alive for audiences of all ages.

Over the past few years, I’ve delivered more than fifteen bilingual presentations—both in person and online—reaching classrooms, libraries, and community centers. Each talk pushes me to think deeply about how history is remembered, who gets to tell it, and how art can illuminate the humanity behind historical events. Through painting and storytelling, I’ve found a voice that not only honors my cultural roots but also connects with others who are exploring their own sense of belonging and heritage.

In 2024, I had the honor of representing youth leaders at the Chinese American Convention in Washington, D.C., an experience that profoundly shaped how I view leadership and advocacy. I helped guide a group of peers on a Capitol Hill visit, conducted interviews with lawmakers about immigrant representation and civic engagement, and delivered a bilingual speech on identity, memory, and what it means to belong. Standing before an audience of policymakers and community leaders, I realized that cultural storytelling extends far beyond the canvas or the classroom—it’s a form of activism, empathy, and bridge-building. These experiences have deepened my commitment to using creativity as a way to amplify underrepresented voices and to ensure that the stories of those who came before us continue to inspire understanding and compassion for generations to come.
