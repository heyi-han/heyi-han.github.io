The pipa is more than an instrument to me—it is a bridge connecting my personal expression, cultural heritage, and community. Through its strings, I explore the stories, emotions, and traditions of Chinese music while sharing this heritage with others. Performing and teaching the pipa allows me to engage with a broader community, fostering appreciation for Chinese culture and creating spaces where music becomes a means of connection, understanding, and shared identity. Each note carries both history and personal meaning, blending the past with my own voice in the present.

Since age ten, I’ve been studying the Chinese lute pipa, an instrument that connects me to both my heritage and my creative voice.
