title: "Music that Connects"
description: "I have studied the Chinese lute, pipa, since age ten—a journey that has become one of the most meaningful parts of my identity. What began as a childhood curiosity has evolved into a lifelong pursuit of artistic expression and cultural connection. Whether performing on stage or practicing quietly alone, I feel a sense of harmony between my cultural roots and my personal growth—each note a reminder of where I come from and how I continue to evolve as both a musician and an individual."

The pipa is more than an instrument to me—it is a bridge connecting my personal expression, cultural heritage, and community. Through its strings, I explore the stories, emotions, and traditions of Chinese music while sharing this heritage with others. Performing and teaching the pipa allows me to engage with a broader community, fostering appreciation for Chinese culture and creating spaces where music becomes a means of connection, understanding, and shared identity. Each note carries both history and personal meaning, blending the past with my own voice in the present.

Since age ten, I’ve been studying the Chinese lute pipa, an instrument that connects me to both my heritage and my creative voice.

I have achieved **Level 9 certification** from the Central Conservatory of Music and received top honors in international competitions, including:

* 1st Place, **New York Golden Classical Music Award** (2023) — Solo performance at Carnegie Hall
* 1st Prize, **Great Composer Competition** (2023)
