       ðŸ‘‹ My name is Helen, and Iâ€™m a high school student who is passionate about <b>communication</b>, <b>creativity</b>, and <b>cultural connection</b>. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
       ðŸ‘‹ From music and art to debate and documentary storytelling, I love exploring how ideas can inspire empathy and change.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        At age eleven, I gave a <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLx9FkPokQ"><b>TEDx Talk</b></a> that sparked my love for public speaking and sharing ideas that matter. In high school, I continued this journey through debate and public speaking competitions, where I learned how to think critically, speak with purpose, and listen with empathy.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        Beyond school, I volunteer as a bilingual speaker for the project <a class="link" href="/experiences/our-voices-our-history"><b>"Our Voice, Our History"</b></a>, a storytelling series sharing Chinese American immigrant experiences, and representing youth voices at the Chinese American Convention in Washington, D.C.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        These experiences inspired me to create <a class="link" href="/experiences/using-the-future-to-tell-the-past"><b>AI-assisted documentaries</b></a> that capture the voices and experiences of Chinese immigrantsâ€”combining technology and storytelling to preserve cultural memory for future generations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        Whether performing, creating, or filming, I hope my work continues to build bridges between cultures and generations, through the power of stories and sharing.
