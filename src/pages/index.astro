       ðŸ‘‹ My name is Helen, and Iâ€™m a high school student who is passionate about communication, creativity, and cultural connection.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        From music and art to debate and documentary storytelling, I love exploring how ideas can inspire empathy and change.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        At age eleven, I gave a <b>TEDx Talk</b> that sparked my love for public speaking and sharing ideas that matter. In high school, I continued this journey through <b>debate and public speaking competitions</b>, where I learned how to think critically, speak with purpose, and listen with empathy. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        Beyond school, I serve as a volunteer bilingual speaker for community projects such as <b>HuÃ¡ TÃ³ng HuÃ </b>, a storytelling series sharing Chinese American immigrant stories. In <b>2024</b>, I represented youth voices at the <b>Chinese American Convention in Washington, D.C.</b>, where I visited Congress, interviewed lawmakers, and delivered a bilingual speech at the celebration event.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-2">
        These experiences inspired me to create <b>AI-assisted documentaries</b> that capture the voices and experiences of Chinese immigrantsâ€”combining technology and storytelling to preserve cultural memory for future generations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Whether performing, creating, or filming, I hope my work continues to build bridges between cultures and generations through the power of stories.
